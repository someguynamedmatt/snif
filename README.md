# SNIF: Simple Network InterFace
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/someguynamedmatt/snif.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/someguynamedmatt/snif)
> Quickly (and cleanly) check the configurations of your network devices
---
```bash
$ snif wlp4s0
```
Supplying your interface name (here shown as `wlp4s0`) will output information about your network device: IPs (IPv4 and IPv6), mac address, etc.

(WIP: feel free to help and learn Rust!)
